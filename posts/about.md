# Why teach Python to VBA Developers?

The story of my transition from VBA to Python could have been so much smoother, and with these tidbits, articles, & translations I'm hoping to make that process easier for other people. 

Microsoft has put a lot of work into getting the Visual Basic Editor (VBE) perfectly integrated with Microsoft Office, and while that's wonderful for non-techy people, it really hinders people who want to grow beyond VBA eventually, as no other language is going to be sandboxed quite so nicely with a development environment and obvious applications of the knowledge acquired.

With that in mind, I'm not interested in this being a start-from-scratch tutorial of Python and all the things that make this language great; there are **plenty** of those around to choose from and I don't feel much more is needed to be said there. Instead, what I'm hoping for this repo to become is something like a Rosetta Stone for those coming from VBA and moving toward Python. I'll point out parts of Python that you can find similarities to in VBA, translations of syntax or how you would go about doing the things you used to do in VBA with this different & much more powerful language.

If you are just now getting started with Python and don't even have it installed yet, I recommend Corey Schafer's videos, starting with [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYXdXT2l-Gg).
