# Naming Conventions

Python as a language is a little more clear with the community about the naming conventions it prefers than VBA. While you obviously don't have to follow those conventions, it does serve to help others be able to make sense of your code.

At a high level, Python prefers [snake_case](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case) for variable and function names, and [PascalCase (aka upper camel case](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case) for class object names.
