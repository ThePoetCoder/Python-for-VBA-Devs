# Arrays

Arrays are used widely in Excel VBA, and Python has a couple different ways to get the functionality of VBA's Arrays.

The most commonly used Python data type to get the functionality of an Array is a `list`. Python lists can be instantiated in either of the following 2 ways:

```python
my_list1 = [1, 2, 3]
my_list2 = list(1, 2, 3)
```

You will get a slight performance boost by using the bracket operators `[]` to create a list instead of using the `list` keyword.
