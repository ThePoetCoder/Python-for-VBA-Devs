# Garbage Collection

Garbage Collection is something many developers have to live with, but Python in particular removes the need for it.

It can be done explicitly in with the `del` keyword, such as `del my_variable` but is not necessary 90% of the time unless you are getting into some very performance heavy Python, or otherwise need to explicitly delete the variable or object you're working with.
