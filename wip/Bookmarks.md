# Bookmarks

To be completely honest, I prefer the way the VBE handles bookmarks rather than PyCharm. Even with tweaking the environment it's difficult to bring back the functionality found. In fact I rarely use the bookmarks feature in PyCharm, and can pretty easily get by without it. The main problem is that even though PyCharm can track bookmarks across the scope of an entire project, it cannot jump back and forth between bookmarks outaide of the currently open document. So if you're writing code that interacts with other files/modules, which is relatively often, you'll have to either use the bookmark GUI or make more use out of the keyboard shortcut `CTRL + B` which is PyCharm's version of the VBE's keyboard shortcut `Shift + F2`, both of which will take you wherever in the codebase the variable you're working with was first defined.
