# Project Structure and Organization

Organizing code in Python is really quite similar to VBA actually. In Python you are free to create as many .py files as you please in much the same manner as you are free to create as many modules in VBA as you please. Organization is not standardized across the entire Python community, nor do I think it should be, as each project has its own logic and flow. 

Maybe you want to put all your 'helper' functions in a separate file and call on them as necessary. Maybe you want to make an entirely separate file for each class, much the same way VBA requires. There are no right or wrong answers here, and while that may be disconcerting to dive into at first, it is also quite freeing once you've started to swim.
